                TFSWIWatcher is a server side plugin which allows you to register for watching workitems in Team Foundation Server 2012. The plugin can be configured to use different logic to retrieve accounts to be notified and to deliver messages to the accounts to be notified.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By default TFSWIWatcher watches all changes of workitems and determines the 
                accounts to be notified by looking up the texbox in a new tab of the workitem 
                called Observers. This tab holds a list of account names - each account name on a 
                singe line:
            </p>

                <span lang="EN-US">TFSWIWatcher will then determine the email addresses of the 
                provided account names and will send a mail to each account.</span>

                <p>
                    If you've not already installed TFPT please download and install it using the link under <b>>> <a href="#Requirements">Requirements</a> <<</b>. You will need TFPT to complete the next step.

                <h3>Adding the Observer-Tab for Workitems</h3>
                <p>
                    After installing TFPT there will be a new Menu under Tools called "Process Editor":
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the next dialog choose one of the provided workitem types (you will need to reapeat the following steps for all other types):

                    Save the result and after opening a workitem you'll have a new Tab "Observers":

                &nbsp;<h3>Installing the Plugin</h3>
                <p>
                    To get the plugin running you have to copy the following files into the Plugins folder of Team Foundation Server 2012 (AppTier). For a standard installation the path to copy the following files would be something like this: &quot;<a href="file:///C:/Program%20Files/Microsoft%20Team%20Foundation%20Server%2011.0/Application%20Tier/Web%20Services/bin/Plugins">C:\Program Files\Microsoft Team Foundation Server 11.0\Application Tier\Web Services\bin\Plugins</a>&quot;</p>
                
                <div>
                    The following files have to be copied to the Plugins folder:
                    <ul style="margin-left: 30px">
                        <li>log4net.dll (The logging framework)</li>
                        <li>TFSWIWatcher.BL.dll (The plugin)</li>
                        <li>TFSWIWatcher.BL.dll.config (You can modify settings for the plugin here)</li>
                        <li>TFSWIWatcher.BL.dll.logconfig (You can modify settings for logging here)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p>
                    Make sure that you have configured your mail settings in the Administrative Console of Team Foundation Server! Because the plugin will use the Mail-Settings of TFS to send mails.<br/>
                    <strong>Dont forgett to restart the TFS App Tier after the Plugin has been deployed!</strong>

                <strong>TFSWIWatcherlog.txt</strong> in the <strong>Temp-Directory</strong> of your server. Lo4Net is used for logging. You can change the way logging is done through modifying the content of the file <strong>TFSWIWatcher.BL.dll.logconfig</strong>:</p>

                    In the configuration file TFSWIWatcher.Service.exe.config there is a section 
                    called <strong>ObserverAccountProviders</strong>. This section lists all providers 
                    collecting accounts to notify. By default there is a single provider in this 
                    list called <strong>TFSObserverAccountProvider</strong>. This provider gets the accounts 
                    from the observer field in the workitem that was changed by parsing the field 
                    line (account name) by line (account name). More information about 
                    ObserverAccountProviders are under <b>&gt;&gt; <a href="#ObserverAccountProviders">this section</a>

                    In the configuration file TFSWIWatcher.Service.exe.config there is a section 
                    called <strong>NotifyProviders</strong> . This section lists all providers 
                    notifying accounts. By default there is a single provider in this 
                    list called <strong>MailNotifyProvider</strong>. This provider notifies the 
                    accounts by getting there mail addresses from user profile and sending them a 
                    mail containing a change report. More information about

                <p>
                    You can add/remove/enable/disable an ObserverAccountProvider by changing the <strong>ObserverAccountProviders section</strong>. By default this section looks like the section below:

                <p>
                    The above configuration is for the <strong>TFSObserverAccountProvider</strong>, which is the default 
                    ObserverAccountProvider. Compared to CredentialsProviders there can be multiple 
                    ObserverAccountProviders. You can disabled a provider by setting the <strong>enabled</strong> attribute to false or by removing the provider from the ObserverAccountProviders section.</p>
                    
                <h3>1. TFSObserverAccountProvider</h3>

                    This provider is the default ObserverAccountProvider
                    to use it just add the line from the above heading. This provider needs further 
                    information which is configured using a custom configuration section. This 
                    section must be registered using the following line:</p>
                    
                <img src="Resources/TFSObserverAccountProviderConfigSectionregistration.jpg" alt="TFSObserverAccountProvider ConfigSection Registration" />
                
                <p>
                    The last step is to add the following section and to customize the settings:

                <p>
                    The setting <strong>ObserverFieldName</strong> is the field of the workitem where the TFSObserverAccountProvider searches for accounts to notify.
                    The default field name is <strong>DNE.Observers</strong>. You can change the name of the field but dont forgett to consider it in <b>
                    &gt;&gt; <a href="#FieldName">this step</a> &lt;&lt;</b>.The <strong>RegexPattern</strong> and 
                    <strong>RegexOptions</strong> field is used to extract the account names from the field holding 
                    the account names. The regular expression used here extracts the account names 
                    line by line. If you want to change the regular expression please consider 
                    having a group called <strong>user</strong> in your regular expression - this is mandatory. 
                    The provider also checks the observers of the previous workitem revision and 
                    will send a single notify mail to accounts that where removed from the list of 
                    observers, so that those observers can detect an unwanted removal from the 
                    list of observer.</p>

                <p>
                    To implement your own NotifyProvider just create a project and reference the assembly <strong>TFSWIWatcher.BL</strong> and create a class implementing the interface <strong>INotifyProvider</strong> which is located in namespace <strong>TFSWIWatcher.BL.Providers</strong>. The interface has the following definition: 
                </p>
                
                <img src="Resources/INotifyProvider.jpg" alt="INotifyProvider" />
                
                <p>
                    The method <strong>Initialize()</strong> is called once by the service to allow the implementing provider to read configuration settings and to do other initialization stuff. The method <strong>Notify(..)</strong> is called each time a workitem change has occured. The implementing provider gets passed a list of accounts to notify for this workitem change as well as a context parameter providing information about the workitem and so on.

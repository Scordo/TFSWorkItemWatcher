                TFSWIWatcher is a service which allows you to register for watching workitems in Team Foundation Server. The service can be configured to use different logic to retrieve accounts to be notified and to deliver messages to the accounts to be notified.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                By default TFSWIWatcher watches all changes of workitems and determines the 
                accounts to be notified by looking up the texbox in a new tab of the workitem 
                called Observers. This tab holds a list of account names - each account name on a 
                singe line:
            </p>

                <span lang="EN-US">TFSWIWatcher will then determine the email addresses of the 
                provided account names and will send a mail to each account.</span>

                <p>
                    On startup the windows service is creating a windows communication foundation 
                    host. It then registeres the wcf host endpoint with team foundation server using 
                    the tfs api. The type of registration is soap. On successful registration with 
                    tfs the service is getting a unique id for the registration. When the service is 
                    shutting down, the unique id is used to unsubscribe from getting further events. 
                    To connect to tfs the service is using a CredentialsProvider which is configured 
                    in the configuration file TFSWIWatcher.Service.exe.config under the 
                    configuration node <strong>CredentialsProvider</strong>. By default the service is using 
                    the <strong>UICredentialsProvider</strong> which takes the credentials the service runs with to 
                    connect to tfs. More information about CredentialsProviders are under <b>&gt;&gt; <a href="#CredentialsProviders">this section</a>

                    In the configuration file TFSWIWatcher.Service.exe.config there is a section 
                    called <strong>ObserverAccountProviders</strong>. This section lists all providers 
                    collecting accounts to notify. By default there is a single provider in this 
                    list called <strong>TFSObserverAccountProvider</strong>. This provider gets the accounts 
                    from the observer field in the workitem that was changed by parsing the field 
                    line (account name) by line (account name). More information about

                    called <strong>NotifyProviders</strong> . This section lists all providers 
                    notifying accounts. By default there is a single provider in this 
                    list called <strong>MailNotifyProvider</strong>. This provider notifies the 
                    accounts by getting there mail addresses from user profile and sending them a 
                    mail containing a change report. More information about

                <p>
                    You can change the CredentialsProvider by changing the values of <strong>assemblyName</strong> and <strong>providerClass</strong> in config <strong>TFSWIWatcher.Service.exe.config</strong>:

                <p>
                
                    The above configuration is for the CredentialsProvider <strong>UICredentialsProvider</strong>, 
                    which is the default provider.</p>
                
            
                <h3>1. UICredentialsProvider</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    This provider is the default CredentialsProvider to use it just change the <strong>CredentialsProvider section</strong> to 
                    look like the one under heading <strong>Choosing a CredentialsProvider</strong>.This 
                    provider takes the credentials the service is running with and communictaes with 
                    team foundation server using this credentials. To use this provider the service 
                    should be cofigured to run with an account having enough rights to communicate 
                    with team foundation server. This provider has no further configuration 
                    settings.</p>
                    
                <h3>2. ConfigCredentialsProvider</h3>
                <p>
                    
                    This provider uses predefined credentials which are configured in config <strong>TFSWIWatcher.Service.exe.config</strong> to communicate with team foundation server. 
                    This his helpful if you want to run the service with very few permissions. Or if 
                    the service is running at a different server then team foundation server and 
                    your running team foundation server without a domain. In this case you&#39;re not 
                    able to run the service under an account name which is able to communicate with 
                    team foundation server. To choose this provider change the <strong>CredentialsProvider section </strong> 
                    to look like the following section:</p>
                    
                <img src="Resources/ConfigCredentialsProviderChoice.jpg" alt="Config Credentials Provider Choice" />
                
                <p>
                    
                    The next step is to register a configuration section for this provider. This 
                    configuration section is used to provider the username, password and domain:</p>
                    
                <img src="Resources/ConfigCredentialsProviderConfigSectionSetup.jpg" alt="Config Credentials Provider Config Section Setup" />
                
                <p>
                    The last step is to add the section where you need to provide the credentials used to connect to team foundation server. 
                    In the following case you see the credentials I&#39;ve used to connect to during 
                    development to test on the VPC image microsoft has provided to test team 
                    foundation server:</p>

                    ObserverAccountProviders. You can disabled a provider by setting the <strong>enabled</strong> attribute to false or by removing the provider from the ObserverAccountProviders section.</p>
                    
                <h3>1. TFSObserverAccountProvider</h3>
                <p>
                    This provider is the default ObserverAccountProvider
                    to use it just add the line from the above heading. This provider needs further 
                    information which is configured using a custom configuration section. This 
                    section must be registered using the following line:</p>
                    
                <img src="Resources/TFSObserverAccountProviderConfigSectionregistration.jpg" alt="TFSObserverAccountProvider ConfigSection Registration" />
                
                <p>
                    The last step is to add the following section and to customize the settings:
                </p>
                
                <img src="Resources/TFSObserverAccountProviderConfigSection.jpg" alt="TFSObserverAccountProvider ConfigSection" />
                
                <p>
                    The setting <strong>ObserverFieldName</strong> is the field of the workitem where the TFSObserverAccountProvider searches for accounts to notify.
                    The default field name is <strong>DNE.Observers</strong>. You can change the name of the field but dont forgett to consider it in <b>
                    &gt;&gt; <a href="#FieldName">this step</a> &lt;&lt;</b>.The <strong>RegexPattern</strong> and 
                    <strong>RegexOptions</strong> field is used to extract the account names from the field holding 
                    the account names. The regular expression used here extracts the account names 
                    line by line. If you want to change the regular expression please consider 
                    having a group called <strong>user</strong> in your regular expression - this is mandatory.</p>
                    
                <h3>1. XMLObserverAccountProvider</h3>
                <p>
                
                    This ObserverAccountProvider is used to define which account gets notified when 
                    a workitem changed using a xml config file. Here is a saple config file:</p>
                    
                <img src="Resources/XMLObserverAccountProviderFileSample.jpg" alt="XMLObserverAccountProvider File Sample" />
                
                <p>
                    In the above example "TFS Setup" will be notified about all changes of every workitem (*). "Darren" will be notified about changes to workitems with ID: 15,11,13,2,3,4,5,6 or 1. And "Brian" will be notified about changes to workitems with ID: 15,2,3,4,5,6 or 7.
                    As you can see in the example its possible to get <strong>notified about changes of all 
                    workitems</strong> using a star (*). Its possible to provide <strong>single IDs</strong> as well as <strong>ranges 
                    of IDs</strong> using a a hyphen between two IDs. To enable this provider add the following line to your 
                    <strong>ObserverAccountProviders section</strong>:</p>
                
                <img src="Resources/XMLObserverAccountProviderRegistration.jpg" alt="XMLObserverAccountProvider Registration" />
                
                <p>
                    This provider needs further information which is configured using a custom 
                    configuration section. This section must be registered using the following line:</p>
                    
                <img src="Resources/XMLObserverAccountProviderConfigRegistration.jpg" alt="XMLObserverAccountProvider Config Registration" />
                
                <p>
                    The last step is to add the following section and to customize the settings:
                </p>
                
                <img src="Resources/XMLObserverAccountProviderConfig.jpg" alt="XMLObserverAccountProvider Config" />
                
                <p>
                    The only setting here is the <strong>file</strong> where to find the xml defining which account gets 
                    notified for which workitem change.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="lightIndent">
                <h3>Choosing a NotifyProvider</h3>
                <p>
                    You can add/remove/enable/disable a NotifyProvider by changing the <strong>NotifyProviders section</strong>. By default this section looks like the section below:
                </p>
                
                <img src="Resources/NotifyProviders.jpg" alt="Notify Providers" />
                
                <p>
                    The above configuration is for the <strong>MailNotifyProvider</strong>, which is the default 
                    NotifyProvider. Compared to CredentialsProviders there can be multiple 
                    NotifyProviders. You can disabled a provider by setting the <strong>enabled</strong> attribute to false or by removing the provider from the NotifyProviders section.</p>
                
                <h3>1. MailNotifyProvider</h3>
                <p>
                    This provider is notifying accounts through sending mails. The mail address of the account names is determined through team foundation server API. 
                    This provider is the default NotifyProvider, to use it just add the line from 
                    the above heading. This provider needs further information which is configured 
                    using a custom configuration section. This section must be registered using the 
                    following line:</p>
                
                <img src="Resources/MailNotifyConfigRegistration.jpg" alt="Mail Notify Config Registration" />
                
                <p>
                    The next step is to add the following section and to customize the settings:
                </p>
                
                <img src="Resources/MailNotifyConfig.jpg" alt="Mail Notify Config" />
                
                <p>
                    The only thing you can do in the above section is to provide the path to a 
                    filename acting as a xsl transformation or you can modify the existing file to 
                    satisfy your needs. 
                    The last step is to configure the settings for sending the mails:

                <p>
                    To implement your own CredentialsProvider just create a project and reference the assembly <strong>Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client</strong> and create a class implementing the interface <strong>ICredentialsProvider</strong> which is located in namespace <strong>Microsoft.TeamFoundation.Client</strong>. The interface has the following definition:

                <p>
                    The method <strong>Initialize()</strong> is called once by the service to allow the implementing provider to read configuration settings and to do other initialization stuff. The method <strong>GetObservers(..)</strong> is called each time a workitem change has occured. The implementing provider should return a list of accounts to be notified for this workitem change. The <strong>context parameter</strong> provides the implementing provider with information about the workitem and so on.
